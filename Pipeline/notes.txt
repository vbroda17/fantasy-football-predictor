To run this you should just have to run 
- data_gathering.py
- data_process.py

then run the helper scripts
get_player_id.py
get_schedule.py

Train the model by running train_model.py
Then Run predict.py and enter either a week of the current season you want predictions for or a test of the predictions

I plan on probably condensing all of this down into a single notebook but right now I think this should be fine and works well.
